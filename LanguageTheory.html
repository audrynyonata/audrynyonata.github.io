  <h1>Theory of Logical Programming with Prolog</h1>
  <h5>Under the topic of Language Theory</h5>
  <div id="content">
  <p>Programming languages are specially used for giving instructions to machines, so that the machines became easier to use. Until now, new languages are still being developed to solve various problems encountered during the process of writing a program code. Using one particular programming language may benefits us, yet creates another problems to solve. Programming languages are highly logical, for some it is even hard to understand. The easier the language is understood by human means the programming language has higher level, and the closer the language to machines behavior means it is a lower level programming language. </p>
  <p>Programming language theory (PLT) is a part of computer science that studies programming languages especially through their design, implementation, analysis, characterization, classification, and their individual features. Besides computer science, PLT is also affiliated with mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. Understanding the logic behind programming languages is vital for understanding computer science concepts, from writing codes to designing a system environment.</p>

  Low level languages are based directly on the machines which they control. For example, low level languages are represented by electrical signals or other physical processes. Meanwhile the high level languages are not related to a specific machine. Higher level languages need to be translated to machine codes by interpreters, compilers, or virtual machines. If not, then the instructions contained in the program are not understandable and can not be executed by the machines. High level languages has several categories, which are imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logical.</p>
  <p>
  One of the most widely used logical programming language is Prolog. Prolog is a programming language which serves  general-purpose logic programming, associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It is based on first-order, formal logic. Prolog is declarative, which means the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages, and remains the most popular among such languages today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving, expert systems,  type inference systems, and automated planning, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.
