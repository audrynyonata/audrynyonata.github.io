  <h1>Theory of Logical Programming with Prolog</h1>
  <h5>Under the topic of Language Theory</h5>
  <p>Programming languages are specially used for giving instructions to machines, so that the machines became easier to use. Until now, new languages are still being developed to solve various problems encountered during the process of writing a program code. Using one particular programming language may benefits us, yet creates another problems to solve. Programming languages are highly logical, for some it is even hard to understand. The easier the language is understood by human means the programming language has higher level, and the closer the language to machines behavior means it is a lower level programming language. </p>
  <p>Programming language theory (PLT) is a part of computer science that studies programming languages especially through their design, implementation, analysis, characterization, classification, and their individual features. Besides computer science, PLT is also affiliated with mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. Understanding the logic behind programming languages is vital for understanding computer science concepts, from writing codes to designing a system environment.</p>
